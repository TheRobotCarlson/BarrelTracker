title: Spring Break Update - Thomas
date: 2019-03-19 12:00:00

This past week was spring break, so I did not accomplish anything. My plan for the next couple weeks is to get started on some usability focused features, such as displaying the names of various pieces of data as opposed to their internal ID (for instance, so the user sees a reference to the Mashbill named "Wilderness Trail Bourbon" instead of "1"). I'm pretty sure that I know how to go about making these changes (mostly changing some HTML files and a base file that JHipster generates some boilerplate for)
