### Final Meeting with Shane
Going into the final meeting with Shane, I was a little concerned. Our team had been pretty busy for most of this semester and didn't have as much time to work on the project as we would have liked. I was organizing CatHacks, a month of workshops, and doing interviews, Clay was looking for where he was going to be living after college and had to travel for work, and Thomas had hard classes and the solar car software team to lead.
