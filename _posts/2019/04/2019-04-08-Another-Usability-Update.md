I admittedly had more trouble implementing the features that I set out to do. I tried following a couple tutorials I found online that aimed to do similar things. None of them worked for me, which I at first put down to the idea that they were not compatible with the stack that we are using. After learning a little bit more about how our stack operates, I managed to make the added changes by adding a couple API calls, added some backend functions, and updated the HTML and Typescript code. The result is that when a user visits the mashbill page, they can see a list of all of the grains and yeasts that belong to this mashbill (a mashbill is basically a recipe)

For this next week, I plan on streamlining the process of actually adding new mashbills (at the moment, it's a long process that involves creating multiple things and involves navigating to multiple pages)
