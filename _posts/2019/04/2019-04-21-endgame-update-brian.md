## Changing requirements 
(or at least our understanding of them)
Before the semester started I toyed with the idea of bringing in my own senior project. I had been talking to a distillery about automating their process and some of the pain points that I could help relieve some stress around. 

### The Barrel Tracker

	At that time the biggest pain point mentioned was tracking barrels. Barrels get moved around between when they're initially placed in the warehouse and when they're ready to be bottled. They didn't have a good system in place for recording these movements, however, leading to a lot of headache searching for barrels and potential product loss if barrels break in the moving process. This was the project that I introduced for senior design, but not the one that we ended up doing.

### Technically still tracking barrels?
	


### Final Meeting with Shane
Going into the final meeting with Shane, I was a little concerned. Our team had been pretty busy for most of this semester and didn't have as much time to work on the project as we would have liked. I was organizing CatHacks, a month of workshops, and doing interviews, Clay was looking for where he was going to be living after college and had to travel for work, and Thomas had hard classes and the solar car software team to lead. There were only one or two weeks where we were all available to meet at once
