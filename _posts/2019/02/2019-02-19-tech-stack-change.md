We recently decided to make a change to part of our tech stack. Initially, we were going to use Python Flask as our back-end and Google Cloud as our cloud service. We have instead opted to use Java Spring Boot as the back-end and Amazon Web Services as our cloud service. The primary reason for this change is so we can utilize JHipster. 

JHipster is a development platform that will allow us to more easily streamline our development process by allowing us to quickly integrate a SQL schema into our application. JHipster works with a back-end of Java Spring Boot and has more integrations with AWS than Google Cloud so we decided to make the change. This change was easy to make since we are still early on in the development process
