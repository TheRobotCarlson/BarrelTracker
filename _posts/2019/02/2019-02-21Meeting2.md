Meeting 2 with Shane

Agenda:

Summary of last time:
talked abour ERP
"How many raw barrels we need to order this month"
Which warehouses are these barrels going into? 
1 person inputs data - verbal
Exceptions module for when things dont go according to plan 

What we want to cover this time: 

How does the mashbill tab relate to the other tabs?
Is each barrel lot ID unique? Or can they repeat? 
How do yeast pallets relate to a schedule â€“ how yeast summary relates to master summary


mashbill = amount of grain per each recipe goes back to grain forecast page
how much grain per month

recpipee is mashbill 

mashbills can be reused 

Barrel lot IDs are unique


Barrel lot ID: first 2 number are the year. third is a letter is the month


3 shifts - 2 different distilation options

_ A shifts on 1 side 

B C D on the other

firm number - batch number - barrels


yeast summary looks at how much yeast to make a barrel


mashbill is hidden


yeast is determined by personal preference

always mining for data - year and month filters

1 hour

M - S 


Questions for next time - what is a pallet consist of? How does it tie back?
